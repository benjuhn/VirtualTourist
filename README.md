Project for Udacity course "iOS Persistence and Core Data"

This iPhone app allows users to select locations on a map and explore Flickr photos related to those locations. The app opens to a map which allows users to drop pins or delete pins. Once a pin is selected, the app uses the Flickr API to download and display photos in a collection view. Selected photos can be removed or the whole collection refreshed. The pins and photos are saved using Core Data.
